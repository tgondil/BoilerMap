  <div id="center-info">
    <h2 style="color:#e0b41c; size: 40px;">Climate change is one of the most pressing issues of our time, and as a team we wanted to create something that would raise awareness about the impact of pollution on our environment. We wanted to create a tool that would make it easy for anyone to understand the real-world effects of industrial pollution and how it contributes to climate change patterns.</p>

    <h1 style="background-color:#e0b41c; ;">What did we learn during the project?</h1>
  <div id="center-info">
    <h2 style="color:#e0b41c; size: 40px;">During the project, we learned about the importance of data cleaning and processing in order to make the information useful and easy to understand. We also learned how to use python libraries such as pandas and plotly to plot and visualize data in an interactive and user-friendly way.</p>
        <h1 style="background-color:#e0b41c; ;">How did we go about visualizing the data??</h1>
  <div id="center-info">
    <h2 style="color:#e0b41c; size: 40px;">We started by gathering publicly available data from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (https://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting/data-sets) on industrial emissions and heat waves. We then used python and pandas to process and clean the data. After that, we used plotly to plot the data on an interactive map, with different colors representing different levels of emissions. We also created a second map showing heat wave data to show the correlation between pollution and extreme weather patterns.</p>
