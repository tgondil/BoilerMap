The project we worked on during Boilermake 2023 helps bring to light a crucial issue in today's world - Climate Change. In essence, the website that we have created visualises Nation-wide pollution data and links it to data of heat waves that have occured across the country in a manner that makes it easy to comprehend the real impact of pollution. We have processed, cleaned and analysed publicly available data from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (https://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting/data-sets) to bring forward an important point about the dangers of the capitalism world. Our primary set of data presents the toxic emissions of factories and manufacturing plants that power the economy.
