The project we worked on during Boilermake 2023 helps bring to light a crucial issue in today's world - Climate Change. In essence, the website that we have created visualises Nation-wide pollution data and links it to data of heat waves that have occured across the country in a manner that makes it easy to comprehend the real impact of pollution. We have processed, cleaned and analysed publicly available data from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (https://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting/data-sets) to bring forward an important point about the dangers of the capitalism world. Our primary set of data presents the toxic emissions of factories and manufacturing plants that power the economy. We have used python libraries, namely pandas and plotly, to plot the data onto an interactive and user-friendly map. The map displays data points of industrial units across the country, color-coded to show the emission values. This form of a map helps understand the geographical trends with relevance to pollution data, highlighting areas with high contributions to climate change patterns. A second map outlines historical data pertaining to heat waves that have affected the country. Both the maps are presented together to call attention to the similarity between the trends visible across both graphs.

Our project focuses on one of the most pertinent issues in society and does so in an effortlessly practical way. It paints a story of how greed has had greatly detrimental effects on the world.
